Had enough of copy and pasting the git commands from drupal.org when switching
between issues? Me too.

NB: All these commands assume your clone of the repo is in a directory with the
same name as the repo.

## Switch issue:

```
doop <issue-number>
```

## Delete issue branch and remote:

```
doop -d <issue-number>
```

## Force delete issue branch and remote:

```
doop -D <issue-number>
```
